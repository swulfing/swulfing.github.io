## Past Research Experience
University of Nebraska-Lincoln

Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium, Cocodrie, Louisiana	1/2020 – 3/2021
Research Assistant
•	Assisted in project that conjoins three different laboratories across the Eastern United States quantifying the methane fluxes using a Los Gatos Gas Analyzer, biomass, and soil and water chemistry of coastal marshland.
•	Further aided as necessary in my coworkers’ projects including fieldwork, data management in Excel and R, and running laboratory instruments such as a fluorometer, photometer, and Gas Chromatograph.

Instituto de Genética, Bogotá, Colombia	8/2019 – 12/2019
Laboratory Assistant
•	Aided a Master thesis on the genetic makeup and structure of Turtle Grass (Thalassia testudinum) by conducting DNA extractions, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), and multiplex PCR on samples of Turtle Grass from five different islands in the Seaflower Biosphere Reserve in the Caribbean.
•	Ran statistical analysis for several projects using the R package adegenet.

DAAD RISE Germany, Münster, Germany	5/2018 – 8/2018
Research Intern
•	Assisted PhD students on a project modeling the greenhouse gas emission of Lake Windsborn Volcanic Eifel Nature Park in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany by using gas chromatography, photometric measurements, radon measurements, and other water collection methods. 
•	Utilized modeling programs such as STELLA and R to compile collected data to make a model of the overall carbon and methane production of Lake Windsborn.
•	Conducted an independent research project observing the emission rates of different forms of sediments to extrapolate these effects on larger lake processes.

NOAA Fisheries, Seattle WA	5/2017 – 8/2017
Research Intern
•	Analyzed rockfish ovaries using light microscopy and modeled rockfish age distribution along the Pacific Coast using data processing systems such as Microsoft Excel and R and co-authored a paper on this project.
•	Collected species samples for the FRAM survey for ten days on a fishing vessel to gather data for researchers and set fishing quotas for future commercial fishing seasons.
