# About Me
I grew up in the beautiful Pacific Northwest, which is where my love of the nature and the outdoors began. In my undergrad at Colorado College, I quickly realized my interest in the intersection of Biology and mathematics. I graduated in 2019 with a degree in Organismal Biology and Ecology and a mathematical biology minor. After working for a few years, I returned to school and am currently getting my Master's in Quantitative Marine Ecology with Dr. Easton White.

## Current Research
Currently, I am pursuing a Mater's in Quantitative Marine Ecology under Dr. Easton White at UNH. My research focuses on applying modeling population dynamics and exploring Socio-Ecological systems using mathematcal methods.

## Past Reasearch Experiences

### University of Nebraska-Lincoln
idk what i did here

### Research Assistant at Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium, Cocodrie, Louisiana	1/2020 – 3/2021
Here, I assisted in project that conjoins three different laboratories across the Eastern United States quantifying the methane fluxes using a Los Gatos Gas Analyzer, biomass, and soil and water chemistry of coastal marshland. Further, I aided as necessary in my coworkers’ projects including fieldwork, data management in Excel and R, and running laboratory instruments such as a fluorometer, photometer, and Gas Chromatograph.

### Laboratory Assistant at Instituto de Genética, Bogotá, Colombia	8/2019 – 12/2019
In Bogotá, I aided a Master thesis on the genetic makeup and structure of Turtle Grass (Thalassia testudinum) by conducting DNA extractions, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), and multiplex PCR on samples of Turtle Grass from five different islands in the Seaflower Biosphere Reserve in the Caribbean. I then ran statistical analysis for several projects using the R package adegenet.

### Research intern at DAAD RISE Germany, Münster, Germany	5/2018 – 8/2018
Assisted PhD students on a project modeling the greenhouse gas emission of Lake Windsborn Volcanic Eifel Nature Park in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany by using gas chromatography, photometric measurements, radon measurements, and other water collection methods. I was able to utilize modeling programs such as STELLA and R to compile collected data to make a model of the overall carbon and methane production of Lake Windsborn. Here, I conducted an independent research project observing the emission rates of different forms of sediments to extrapolate these effects on larger lake processes.

### Research Intern at NOAA Fisheries, Seattle WA	5/2017 – 8/2017
My project here analyzed rockfish ovaries using light microscopy and modeled rockfish age distribution along the Pacific Coast using data processing systems such as Microsoft Excel and R and co-authored a paper on this project. I also collected species samples for the FRAM survey for ten days on a fishing vessel to gather data for researchers and set fishing quotas for future commercial fishing seasons.
